                <p>Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL ) is a yet another test to measure the English language
                    ability of non-native speakers wishing to enroll in Foreign Universities. The test is accepted by
                    many English-speaking academic and professional institutions. TOEFL is one of the two major
                    English-language tests in the world, the other being the IELTS. </p>
                <p>TOEFL is a trademark of the Educational Testing Service (ETS), a private non-profit organization,
                    which designs and administers the tests. ETS issues official score reports, sent independently to
                    institutions, for two years following the test.</p>

                    Since its introduction in late 2005, the TOEFL Internet-based Test (iBT) format has progressively
                    replaced the computer-based tests (CBT) and paper-based tests (PBT), although paper-based testing is
                    still used in select areas. The TOEFL iBT test has been introduced in phases, with the United
                    States, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy in 2005 and the rest of the world in 2006, with test
                    centers added regularly.].

                <p>The Writing section measures a test taker's ability to write in an academic setting and consists of
                    two tasks: one integrated and one independent. In the integrated task, test-takers read a passage on
                    an academic topic and then listen to a speaker discuss it. The test-taker then writes a summary
                    about the important points in the listening passage and explains how these relate to the key points
                    of the reading passage. In the independent task, the test-taker must write an essay that states
                    their opinion or choice, and then explain it, rather than simply listing personal preferences or
                    choices. Responses are sent to the ETS OSN and evaluated by at least 3 different raters.</p>
                <p>
                    One of the sections of the test will include extra, uncounted material. Educational Testing Service
                    includes extra material to pilot test questions for future test forms. When test-takers are given a
                    longer section, they should give equal effort to all of the questions because they do not know which
                    question will count and which will be considered extra. For example, if there are four reading
                    passages instead of three, then one of the passages will not be counted. Any of the four could be
                    the uncounted one.
