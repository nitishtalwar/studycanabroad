                    </p>

                    <p>Do you find phrasal verbs difficult?</p>
                    <p>They are much simpler than you might think. You need to learn them like any other vocabulary
                        word.</p>
                    <p>So, here are 10 new phrasal verbs that you can add in your word stock to bring a difference in
                        your speaking, which will sound more natural, like a native speaker.</p>
                    <p>Alright , so let’s get started.</p>

                    <h5 class="mb-2">
                        <strong class="col-grey font-space">1. Carry On</strong>
                    </h5>

                    <p>So, the first phrasal verb is “carry on.” It means ‘continue’.</p>
                    <p>When someone ask you “What are you doing?” after hearing your answer that person will say, “Oh,
                        Ok then carry on, continue with what you are doing now.”</p>
                    <p>The phrase “carry on” is a bit shorter, rapid, and you are going to hear this as people use this
                        a lot.</p>
                    <h5 class="mb-2">
                        <strong class="col-grey font-space">2. Hold On</strong>
                    </h5>

                    <p>This you might hear as an exclamation, someone telling you “hold on a second, please!” So, this
                        means wait.</p>
                    <p>For example, you’re talking on the phone with someone, maybe you’re talking on the phone with
                        your mother, and you are cooking something at the same time. And suddenly you come to know that
                        the food is burning, you’ll say “hold on, mom, I have to take the food off now, I’ll be right
                        back with you.”</p>
                    <p>So, you can use this in any situation where you tell someone to wait.</p>
                    <h5 class="mb-2">
                        <strong class="col-grey font-space">3. Come Up With</strong>
                    </h5>

                    <p>Ok, the next phrasal verb is “come up with.” So, you come up with something, what is the meaning
                        of this now?</p>
                    <p>So, come up with something is to invent something, or to think about something means to create a
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, if you have some sort of problem, and you don’t know its solution, you say “oh, I’ll
                        come up with something to figure this out.”</p>
                    <h5 class="mb-2">
                        <strong class="col-grey font-space">4. Get Along </strong>
                    </h5>

                    <p>Get along with someone means that you have a good relationship with them. So, If someone ask you
                        “What do you think of him?” then you will say, “Yes, I like him as I get along well with him.”
                        Because you like the way he lives as the same as you but if there is something you don’t like
                        about him then you can say, “I don’t like him as I don’t get along with him.”</p>
                        <h5 class="mb-2">
                        <strong class="col-grey font-space">5. Watch Out </strong>
                        </h5>
                        <p>The next one is “watch out!” So, this is also an exclamation.</p>
                        <p>Watch out means to be careful, or any situation regarding this.</p>
                        <p>For example, you are going on the road with your friend and you both need to cross the road. You see one car is coming and you make your friend careful by saying, “Hey! watch out!”</p>
